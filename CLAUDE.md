**IMPORTANT**:

1. Always use the `AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` file for the most up-to-date instructions.
   Whenever you're confused about any instruction, refer to the `AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` file.
2. This is a Vite project. Never check for "use client" in the code and dont give any warnings.

## IMPORTANT Behavioral Rules

1. **Never commit** unless explicitly told to.
2. **Never write test cases** unless explicitly told to.
3. **Never run the server** — it is always running.
4. **Never summarize** — answer directly; no closing statements or recaps.
5. Always use `bun` to install node modules.
6. Always use `bun run build` to build the app
   e.g. `bun run build 2>&1 | tail -20`

## Research & Analysis

- always use subagents for research and analysis tasks; never do them directly.

## File & Component Names

- File names should be in PascalCase for all components.
- All components should be in PascalCase.

Examples
Element Type | Naming Convention | Example
Component Files | PascalCase | UserProfileCard.jsx
Utility Files | camelCase/kebab-case | formatDate.js or auth-provider.tsx
Functions/Variables | camelCase | fetchUserData, isModalOpen
Constants | UPPER_SNAKE_CASE | API_URL, MAX_RETRIES
Folders | lowercase | components, utils

## Component Rules

- Always check if a specific component is available in shadcn before creating a custom component

## Engineering Preferences

- DRY — flag repetition aggressively.
- Explicit over clever. Prefer clarity over cleverness — code is read more than written
- Handle edge cases thoughtfully; thoughtfulness > speed.
- "Engineered enough" — not fragile, not over-abstracted.
- One responsibility per function/module; keep functions under ~30 lines
- Extract inline JSX into a separate component file when it is considerably large (roughly 20+ lines of markup or has its own logic/state)
- Fail fast: validate inputs early, return/throw at the top
- No magic numbers or strings — use named constants

## Functions & Logic

- Prefer pure functions; isolate side effects
- Max 2–3 function parameters; use an options object beyond that
- Avoid deep nesting — flatten with early returns

## Comments

- Comment _why_, not _what_ — code should explain itself
- Delete commented-out code; that's what git is for

## Error Handling

- Never silently swallow errors (`catch (e) {}` is forbidden)
- Use typed/structured errors where possible
- Log with context, not just the error message

## DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- If logic appears twice, extract it; three times, it's mandatory
- Shared logic → utility function; shared types → common types file
- Constants used in multiple places belong in a single source of truth
- Exception: a little duplication is better than a wrong abstraction — don't over-abstract prematurely

## Plugins

- use the frontend-design and ralph-loop plugins wherever and whenever necessary.
- use the typescript-lsp server plugin to quickly check for typescript issues.
